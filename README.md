# Sample Django Project

Welcome to the **Sample Django Project** repository! This is a minimal Django application designed to help you get started with Django development or serve as a base for your projects.

## Features

- Django framework setup with default configurations.
- Modular project structure for easy scalability.
- Docker support for containerized development and deployment.
- Ready-to-use SQLite database for local development.
- Basic settings configured for development and production environments.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sample-django-project.git
cd sample-django-project
```

### 2. Build and run the Docker containers
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker image defined in the `Dockerfile`.
- Start the Django application and the associated services (if any) defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 3. Apply migrations (if not already applied)
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Create a superuser (optional, for accessing the admin panel)
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
